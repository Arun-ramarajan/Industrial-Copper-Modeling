The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting copper prices in the manufacturing industry. The project will focus on addressing data challenges, such as skewness and noisy data, and building regression and classification models to predict continuous variable 'Selling_Price' and binary variable 'Status' (WON or LOST) respectively. Additionally, a user-friendly Streamlit web application will be created to allow users to make predictions on new data.


Skills Gained from this Project:

1. Python scripting for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, outlier detection using IQR or Isolation Forest, and data normalization.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Machine learning modeling for regression and classification tasks using Scikit-learn.
5. Feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
6. Creating an interactive web application using Streamlit to showcase the trained models and make predictions on new data.




Requirements, the following libraries to be installed:

1. matplotlib
2. seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. Streamlit
6. plotly
7. scipy
8. numpy
